### 🌟 Hi there

I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Computational Physics at the University of Sydney (USYD). In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm a fervent user of Linux, particularly fond of ArchLinux and KDE Plasma. Apart from technology, I also harbor a passion for photography. My photographic works are usually publicized on Flickr.
