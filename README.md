### 🌟 Hi there

I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Computational Physics at the University of Sydney (USYD). In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm a fervent user of Linux, particularly fond of ArchLinux and KDE Plasma. Apart from technology, I also harbor a passion for photography. My photographic works are usually publicized on Flickr. My hobbies are diverse, spanning from basketball, weightlifting, music, and  to an appreciation for Western culture. Follow me on Instagram to explore me more. :)
